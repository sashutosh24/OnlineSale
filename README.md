This Python script processes transaction data to calculate and analyze key metrics for online sales, focusing on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Valueâ€”essential components of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis.

Key Functionalities:
Dataset Loading:

The script loads a dataset named Online_Sales.csv using pandas. This dataset likely contains customer transaction details, including transaction dates, customer IDs, and purchase prices.
Data Preprocessing:

Ensures that the Transaction_Date column is converted to a datetime format for accurate date-based calculations.
CLV Metric Calculation:

Recency: Measures the number of days since a customer's last transaction, using the most recent transaction date as the reference.
Frequency: Counts the number of unique transactions per customer.
Monetary Value: Sums the total transaction value (Avg_Price) for each customer.
Revenue: Represents the total monetary value for each customer.
Customer Segmentation:

Groups data by CustomerID to aggregate these metrics and reset the index for further analysis.
Sorting by CLV:

Customers are sorted by their calculated CLV to identify high-value customers.
Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.
